## Seting up a publisher's page
Publisher Page - is the page, where you can see the publisher and all the apps he deployed.

You can reach it if you click on the publisher name in on the left side of the published app.   
Like here:

Set publisher name in a Name field of the [account settings page](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/account).

Publisher name is clickable and opens the page with all the apps of the publisher:
[Example 1](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/user/Eduard%20Lebedyuk/i0izhXgB7qUs5qHrMpzMzOlfHA), [Example 2](https://openexchange.intersystems.com/user/Evgeny%20Shvarov/PsVoekohQP54VMJhkXmYMe96mPo).

You can introduce descriptions and links which would be placed on the top of the app-list like here:

This can be setup in an account settings page as well. Use markdown to setup the description and links.

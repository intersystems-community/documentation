    This will create a new draft of your application and open the Application Editor.

    This will save a draft of your application, which you can submit for publication in the next step.
    **Note:** You can still make changes to the description, tags, etc., or change the app logo.

3. If you want to change the application logo, open the Settings menu and select the "Upload image" section.

    This will allow you to upload a new image for your application logo from your computer.

4. Once you've finished making changes to the app and/or uploading a new logo, you can submit your changes for approval with the "Send for approval" button.

    Your application will be reviewed and approved by OEX managers, and then will be published with all updates.
